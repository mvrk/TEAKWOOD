Handle your job in seven steps
-------------------------------

Since the workflow provided us a big picture of how Scgate works, here are seven steps that can help us run
a general simulocean job.


Create a **project**
``````````````````````
In the first step, you will need to creating a project, Scgate will generate an file management directory for you automatically.

Select a **model**
```````````````````
After project creating, you need to chose a model(e.g. Delft3D) for job running. We provide five models so far.

   :align: center

Create a **job**
````````````````````

You can create jobs underneath then.

**Insert** your input parameters
`````````````````````````````````
 You can submit your input parameters either by **upload input files** or **fill in input forms**:

.. image:: ../doc/_static/cinput1.png
   :height: 160 px
   :width: 667 px
   :align: center

.. image:: ../doc/_static/cinput2.png
   :height: 260 px
   :width: 667 px
   :align: center


**Submit** your job
````````````````````
Simply submit your job, and your job will be in the waiting list and ready to go.

**Check** status
`````````````````

Check status during the Job running from Scgate control panel. All your jobs are under control.

**Post-process**
````````````````
In this step, we provide output data visualization and comparison. Details please see
**Chapter 5. Data Observation** segment in the directory.
