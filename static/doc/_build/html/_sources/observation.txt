Coastal Data Factory
====================

.. topic:: CDF(Coastal Data Factory)

    Coastal Data Factory(CDF) is a toolkit for grabbing, storing, and visualizing coastal
    data in the northern gulf and beyond. CDF provides an on-demand data grabbing engine, which allows users to easily
    fetch data from both external data sources(e.g.NOAA, USGS) and internal CDF data center, and generates formatted data
    for future use. The CDF client could be easily adapted as an independent tool for grabbing coastal
    data. In our Teakwood framework, we use CDF to verify and validate simulation output.

Coastal data factory(CDF) provides the following functions:

Grabbing observational data.
-------------------------------------
Teakwood provides an on-demand data grabbing engine, so that user can easily fetch time series data from public data
sources(e.g.NOAA USGS).

Host your data.
-----------------
We provide free cloud storage to store your simulation data and crabbed data in standard formats.

visualize your data.
-------------------------
CDF can transform your numerical data into dynamic charts so as to provide you an visual way of understanding your data.

validate your computing result.
---------------------------------
Though CDF platform,you can validate your computing result among your 1)standard referring data,
2)public observational data and 3) your simulation data.
