            Circa 2011 Bathymetric Dynamic Digital Elevation Model (Stage 2) for the Northern Gulf of Mexico</strong>

        <p>
            The Circa 2011 Bathymetric Dynamic Digital Elevation Model (BDDEM) is a digital elevation model developed to
            support coastal hazards modeling and assessment efforts. The BDDEM contains National Ocean Service
            bathymetric
            data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama to Louisiana) from 1888 – 2011. The BDDEM bathymetry
            integrates the National Geophysical Data Center’s digital elevation models in the northern Gulf of Mexico
            with
            all subsequent National Ocean Service bathymetric surveys from 2002 – 2011. The BDDEM was developed for the
            Northern Gulf Coastal Hazards Collaboratory (a NSF – EPSCOR funded project) by the project team from The
            University of Southern Mississippi’s Department of Marine Science.
