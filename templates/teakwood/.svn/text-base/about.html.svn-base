            We aim to create a computational platform for coastal modelers and beyond with
            our competitiveness and expertise on high performance computing technology and
            software application.

            Simulocean is a web-based deployment and visualization
            framework for coastal modeling and beyond.
            As shown in the diagram below, Simulocean collects observational data, schedules
            modeling codes for execution, manages data transfer, visualizes both observational and
            numerical results. With all the information collected, Simulocean can also
            provide direct validation and verification for models, and generate high quality
            technical reports. It provides:
